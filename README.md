## Why Did I Build This ‚ùì / How I built this ü§î

The spirit of God has laid it upon my heart last year (2023) to build a confession app. Then, I was in KTI (Kingsword Training Institute) Level 1. I didn't pay much attention to till last month (October 2024). Holy Spirit told me again and this time I was like yeah, I've to build this. I did some research to know if someone has built something like this before but to my suprise, I found none. Most bible related extensions were just typical bible verses chrome extensions and there wasn't a site where I could get a lot of confessions from. So I started building mine. I got confessions from Kingsword Chicago website. <https://chicago.kingsword.org>. And then I did some editing and then I had about 1,000 confessions. I got more confessions from my Deacon in church, then from my local church installation <https://kingswordalagbado.org>. After compling everthing, I had about 2k confessions to start with. I built an API out of it and then contacted Frames. Frames is a cool guy I meet at Osca Fest (Tech event) last year. To my suprise he agreed to work on the project with me. I was so suprised because everytime I tried reaching out to a UI designer to work on a projct together, it is either I get aired or most times they are busy with other projects which I totally understand. He stated working and then bingo Frames was done. Then I started cooking, and then before I knew it, I was done. I deployed the web version, tested it and sent it to my friends. I then packaged the extension to submit on chrome store. To my suprise, creating a developer account on Chrome costs $5. I was shocked. I had some funds on me but spending $5 on something I built for free and didn't monetize wasn't something I expected. But then, this zeal that woudln't allow me end this project just because of $5. I eventually paid the funds and published the extension to chrome store.
